Rust is a low-level language optimized for performance, memory, and reliability. It's one of the most loved languages according to multiple StackOverflow surveys. It's used in systems development for tools like WebAssembly and game engines.

## How to Run

Follow the steps [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install a Rust compiler. It comes with Cargo, a package manager that's recommended to compile and run Rust files. Once you're all set up, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```
