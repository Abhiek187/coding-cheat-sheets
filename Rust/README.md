# Rust

Rust is a low-level language optimized for performance, memory, and reliability. It's one of the most loved languages according to multiple StackOverflow surveys. Instead of garbage collection, Rust uses a borrow checker to ensure code is safe during compile time, making it tough to get a segfault at runtime. It's used in systems development for tools like WebAssembly and game engines.

## How to Run

Follow the steps [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install a Rust compiler. It comes with Cargo, a package manager that's recommended to compile and run Rust files. Once you're all set up, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```
