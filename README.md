# Coding Cheat Sheets

This is a collection of programs that showcases basic functionalities in each programming language (that I know of).

Core concepts include\*:

- Hello World
- Variables (e.g., int, char, enums, structs, null)
- Input/Output
- Math Operations (e.g., +, -, \*, /, %)
- Logical Operators (e.g., and, or, not)
- Conditional Operators (e.g., if, else)
- Loops (e.g., while, for)
- Pointers
- Optionals
- Functions
  - String Methods
  - Docstrings
  - Recursion
  - Generics
  - Operator Overloading
- Arrays
  - Static & Dynamic Arrays
  - Array Methods
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Classes (constructors & destructors)
  - Encapsulation (access modifiers)
  - Inheritance (base & derived classes)
  - Abstraction (interfaces & abstract classes)
  - Polymorphism (virtual classes & functions)

\*Note that not all languages support these features. And some languages like SQL operate using their own syntax.

## When did you come up with the idea?

In 2018, I was learning Python and was bombarded with so much info about its syntax. To help me retain all the information, I created `how_to_python.py`, a culmination of all the basic Python syntax into one program. I was very proud of the end product that I considered doing something similar to other programming languages. However, I never committed to the idea until a few years later.

Python was a language I would utilize, but not regularly. So, to jog my memory, I would always refer back to `how_to_python`. One day when I was stuck at home, I looked back at that program and remembered just how useful it was to have a cheat sheet you could run. I had plenty of free time on my hand, so I finally decided to incorporate multiple languages into this long-overdue project.

## How can I utilize this repo?

Each language is divided into folders, where each folder contains a separate **README** detailing the backstory of each language and how to run each file. From there, you can learn how each component of a language comes together. Note that this only covers the basics of a language. Please refer to the documentation or take a learning course to thoroughly learn a particular language.

## Fun Facts

_Note: Excluding CSS, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and SQL since they're not typical procedural languages_
