# Coding Cheat Sheets
This is a collection of programs that showcases basic functionalities in each programming language (that I know of).

## When did you come up with the idea?
In 2018, I was learning Python and was bombarded with so much info about its syntax. To help me retain all the information, I created `how_to_python.py`, a culmination of all the basic Python syntax into one program. I was very proud of the end product that I considered doing something similar to other programming languages. However, I never committed to the idea until a few years later.

Python was a language I would utilize, but not regularly. So, to jog my memory, I would always refer back to `how_to_python`. One day when I was stuck at home, I looked back at that program and remembered just how useful it was to have a cheat sheet you could run. I had plenty of free time on my hand, so I finally decided to incorporate multiple languages into this long-overdue project.

## How can I utilize this repo?
Each language is divided into folders, where each folder contains a separate __README__ detailing the backstory of each language and how to run each file. From there, you can learn how each component of a language comes together. Note that this only covers the basics of a language. Please refer to the documentation or take a learning course to thoroughly learn a particular language.
