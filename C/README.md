# C

![C Logo](img-c.png)

C is one of the oldest programming languages out there, dating back to 1972. Despite this, it's still widely used today. Since it can be directly compiled to assembly language, C is one of the fastest (procedural-based) languages, making it very useful for low-level functionality. C's syntax has also inspired many others in this list, such as Java and C#, making it relatively straightforward to understand for experienced developers. But since C is near low-level, developers are responsible for managing things like memory allocation and pointers, making it far from beginner-friendly.

## How to Run

Follow the steps [here](https://www.guru99.com/c-gcc-install.html) to install gcc, a C compiler. A makefile is included to make compiling easier. Once you're all set up, run the following commands:

```
make all
./HowToC.out
```

The `.out` file is ignored by git. You can delete it by running `make clean`.
