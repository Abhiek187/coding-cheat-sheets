Scala is a scalable language. Like Kotlin, it's a simplified extension of Java, but with a focus on functional programming. However, it still supports object-oriented programming. One use case for functional languages like Scala is parallel processing of big data using tools like Hadoop MapReduce or Apache Spark.

## How to Run

Make sure Scala is [installed](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/). Then run the following:

```bash
scalac HowToScala.scala
scala HowToScala
```
