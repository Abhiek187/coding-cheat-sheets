# TypeScript
![TypeScript Logo](img-typescript.png)

TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript that allows developers to specify the types of variables. This one change promotes safer usage of JavaScript since it can catch errors during compile time. TypeScript also supports features present in most other languages like enums, interfaces, and generics. It's actually one of my favorite languages as of this writing due to its nice balance of compile-time safety and lightweight syntax, and due to its large number of use cases alongside JavaScript.

Setting up TypeScript is pretty simple. You would type `tsc --init` in the command line to generate a `tsconfig.json` file, then create a `.ts` file, and code like you would in JavaScript, with the additional benefits TypeScript provides. Given your environment supports TypeScript, this is a great option to replace coding in plain JavaScript.

## How to Run
Follow the directions [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) to get TypeScript installed on your machine. From there, type `tsc` to convert `how-to-typescript.ts` into a JavaScript file. Then follow the steps in the [HTML README](../HTML) to display the results in the browser. You can edit `tsconfig.json` to configure the compilation options.
