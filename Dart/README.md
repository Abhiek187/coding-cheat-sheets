# Dart

![Dart Logo](img-dart.png)

Dart is an open-source language developed by Google. It's primarily used with Flutter, a tool that lets developers create cross-platform apps for web and mobile. It's designed to quickly build UIs across all platforms in a language similar to its contemporaries (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, etc.).

## How to Run

Follow the steps [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart) to install Dart. Installing Flutter is optional for this program. Once you're all set up, run the following command:

```
dart how_to_dart.dart
```
