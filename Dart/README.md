# Dart

![Dart Logo](img-dart.png)

C++ is an object-oriented extension of the C language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. In addition to the regular C syntax, C++ supports classes, inheritance, encapsulation, exception handling, and much more. While C++ tends to be criticized for its complicated nature, it is still a widely used language due to its efficient speeds similar to C. If you plan to work with embedded systems that require low-level architecture and fast speeds, expect C++ to play a big part in that role. This cheat sheet mainly focuses on syntax exclusive to C++, but much of the C cheat sheet can be carried over to here as well.

## How to Run

Follow the steps [here](https://www.guru99.com/c-gcc-install.html) to install a C++ compiler. Note that these are the same instructions as in C. gcc can be used to compile C++ files, but g++ is recommended. A makefile is included to make compiling easier. Once you're all set up, run the following commands:

```
dart how_to_dart.dart
```
