# JavaScript

JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages out there. Despite having Java in the name, the two languages aren't related to each other, besides some similar C-style syntax. JavaScript was designed since the beginning to work on browsers. It was initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, and was later changed to JavaScript in the hopes that it would work alongside Java applets in the browser. While it initially seemed like JavaScript was trying to piggyback off of Java's popularity, ironically the tables have turned.

Modern browsers have stopped supporting Java plugins for the past few years. Meanwhile, JavaScript has grown to become the de facto web development language. (Even languages like TypeScript have to be compiled into JavaScript to be understood by the browser.) Besides that, JavaScript is widely used in back-end development thanks to NodeJS. Any sort of web-based service or API is going to utilize this language. It's even used for cross-platform mobile development. Essentially, JavaScript is a must-learn language for any aspiring developer out there.

## How to Run
JavaScript is often linked with an HTML document to handle the logic of a website. See the [HTML README](../HTML) for directions on how to view the webpage. For more on JavaScript, check out the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
