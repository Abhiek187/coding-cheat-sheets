# Ruby
![Ruby Logo](img-ruby.png)

Ruby was built by Yukihiro Matsumoto and was designed to be easy to read and understand. Ruby, much like Python, is more about English vocabulary and less about semicolons. It's mainly used in back-end development with the Ruby on Rails framework. If you're familiar with iOS development, CocoaPods is used to manage dependencies and that is built off of Ruby.

## How to Run
Make sure Ruby is [installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), then run `ruby how_to_ruby.rb`. For more on Ruby, check out the [documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/).
