# Ruby

![Ruby Logo](img-ruby.png)

Ruby was built by Yukihiro Matsumoto and was designed to be easy to read and understand. Ruby, much like Python, is more about English vocabulary and less about semicolons. It's mainly used in back-end development with the Ruby on Rails framework. It also powers CI/CD pipelines for mobile apps through Fastlane. If you're familiar with iOS development, CocoaPods is used to manage dependencies and that is built off of Ruby.

## How to Run

Make sure Ruby is [installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), then run `ruby how_to_ruby.rb`. If you get the following error: `cannot load such file -- cmath (LoadError)`, you will also need to run `gem install cmath`. For more on Ruby, check out the [documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/).
