# JSON

![JSON Logo](img-json.png)

JSON isn't technically a programming language but is the standard for sending data over a network. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. So yes, it's based on JavaScript objects. But, it's a universal format that can be parsed by any programming language with its simple key-value pair syntax. Compared to XML, JSON is more lightweight and human-readable.

Since JSON doesn't support comments, let me briefly explain this file here. It shows all the data types that JSON supports. You can verify that it's valid JSON [here](https://jsonlint.com/).

## How to Run

You can't run JSON by itself, but you can integrate it with other apps. Check the [HTML README](../HTML) to see this in action. For more info on JSON, [check out their main site](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
