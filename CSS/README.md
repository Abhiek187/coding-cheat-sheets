# CSS

![CSS Logo](img-css.png)

CSS allows developers to stylize their websites. By supplying rules, web pages can have customized colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts. The best part is that you can set different properties for each element and see their effects in real-time within the browser.

## How to Run

CSS is often linked with an HTML document to render a website. See the [HTML README](../HTML) for directions on how to view the webpage. For more on CSS, check out the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
