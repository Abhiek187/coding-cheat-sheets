# Shell

![Shell Logo](img-shell.png)

The command line has been around since the 1960s. It was the primary way of interacting with computers before GUIs and mice were invented. Despite modern interfaces being more user-friendly, the command line is still around for users who want to type commands that are snappy and require minimal overhead. The shell is responsible for interpreting text into commands the machine can understand. The most popular shell is bash (Bourne-Again SHell), the default on Unix-based systems. Developers can write shell scripts to automate processes for even quicker workflows.

## How to Run

A command line is needed to run this program. On Windows, make sure Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) [is enabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Then run the following:

`./how_to_shell.sh # to execute the script in a separate shell`

or

`source how_to_shell.sh # to execute the script in the same shell`

For more on Shell, check out the [documentation](https://devdocs.io/bash/).
