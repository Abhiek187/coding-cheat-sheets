# Java

![Java Logo](img-java.png)

Java is the first language I learned as it's the language many introductory college courses teach. While it's not the most beginner-friendly language out there, it strikes a good balance between low-level and high-level functionality. This means that while Java can handle things like garbage collection for you, you still have to know how to declare variables, functions, and classes in terms of their access modifiers, static nature, and data types. Hence Java has one of the most verbose "Hello World!" programs of the languages listed. Java has a big part in Android development, though Kotlin seems to be slowly replacing it. Otherwise, Java is used to create servers using the Spring framework.

## How to Run

You will need to [install Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and save the path to an [environment variable](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml). Make sure you're running Java 8+. From there, run the following lines:

```bash
javac HowToJava.java
java HowToJava
```
