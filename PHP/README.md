PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (a recursive acronym). It's a scripting language that is used by many websites to handle server-side logic, such as form handling, user authentication, and file processing.

## How to Run

PHP can either be installed with a web server (such as a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)) or standalone through the CLI. See https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.general.php for instructions on installing PHP. Then run:

```bash
php how_to_php.php
```
